# ECE298-HomeSecurity
Software side of our ECE298 Home Security System Prototype. 

Implemented with a Texas Instruments MSP430FR4133 MCU. Decided to use four reed switches to represent "different zones" in a "household".
Detection of anything magnetic closes the local circuit and sends an output signal to our audio transduscer (essentially our alarm system).
